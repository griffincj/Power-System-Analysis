# Power-System-Analysis
This is the project for the ECE2774 project

For milestone 1, ``main.py`` contains all initializations of each instance of the 
classes required for the project model. By running ``main.py``, 7 buses, 6 transmission lines,
and 2 transformers are created.

For milestone 2, ``main.py`` also creates an instance of the PowerSystem class, and calls
its method to calculate the y-bus matrix. See the writeup in the writeups folder
for more information.
