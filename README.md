# Power-System-Analysis
This is the project for the ECE2774 project

Please select the milestone for grading from the branches dropdown.

For milestone 1, ``main.py`` contains all initializations of each instance of the 
classes required for the project model. By running ``main.py``, 7 buses, 6 transmission lines,
and 2 transformers are created.

The ``main.py`` method will print the sample transformer and transmission line impedance and admittance
(and total shunt for transmission line) from HW1.
